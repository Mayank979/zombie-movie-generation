did n t no it s ok it s the truth i ca n t leave the block if it s the two of us something might happen to me hannah d be alone i could n t risk it but with other people if it s a recording the soldiers who made it could be dead it s possible that stuff about the answer to infection there is no answer it s already done all the damage it can maybe they have a cure maybe they ve got nothing the only way to find out is to reach them we could die trying frank or die here and anyway it is n t true what dad said you need us just the same as we need you we need each other and we ll never be safe in the cities the soldiers could keep us safe so we have to try and get there get there how just so you know i do n t take cheques or credit cards what do you think it s the most direct route

now it s all just fucked so you heard our broadcast yeah we did we must be a disappointment you were hoping for a full brigade an army base with helicopters and a field hospital we were just hoping for the answer to infection yeah as i said before it s here though it may not be quite what you imagined just feel lucky to have found you you were lucky the fire drove hundreds of infected out of manchester the surrounding area s teeming with them but do n t worry you re quite safe here flat terrain all round the house floodlights which we ve rigged up to a generator high perimeter wall which helps and we ve been lacing the ground with tripwires and land mines you would n t want to mow the lawn but if they get in we hear them secondary to protection our real job is to rebuild start again the belly of the house the heart a wood fired boiler providing us with hot water the first step towards civilisation the kitchen here you are i ll swap you now do n t be throwing it here give us some do n t be fighting will you put that back put it back jones our resident tin opener what are you cooking jones surprise sir i ca n t wait and lastly meet mailer mailer jim jim mailer got infected two days ago mitchell managed to knock him out cold and we got a chain round his neck keeping him alive the idea was to learn something about infection have him teach me and has he in a way he s telling me he ll never bake bread farm crops raise livestock he s telling me he s futureless and eventually he ll tell me how long the infected take to starve to death you ll have to wait and see hope it s chips it s chips we hope it s chips it s chips hat so what have we here tinned ham tinned peas tinned beans and nice one doris omelette it s a feast jones honour of our guests absolutely i was going to propose a toast but this omelette will do just as well to new friends new friends jones did you notice while cooking that these eggs were off i thought the salt might cover the taste sir get rid of it doris you twat i do n t suppose you can cook can you i ca n t tell you how badly we need someone with a little flair in the kitchen what a fucking disappointment i saw those eggs i thought it was christmas we ll have eggs again once everything s back to normal you muppet look at him eh he s still waiting for marks and spencer s to reopen you do n t know nothing i think bill s got a point if you look at the whole life of the planet we you know man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye so if the infection wipes us all out that is a return to normality that what you meant bill yeah yeah have you met our new age sergeant our spiritual guru tell me farrell exactly why did you join the army in the first place this is what i ve seen in the four weeks since infection people killing people which is what i saw in the four weeks before infection the four weeks before that as far back as i care to remember people killing people which to my mind puts us in a state of normality now you re not eating i do n t want to eat you must eat hannah i do n t want to eat i want to bury my dad he s one of the people you re talking about let s go let s go let s go move move

he was a sweetheart next to rhodes we could be in real trouble you d better watch yourself i mean physically watch yourself i can handle it don t worry it s not going to come to that we ve just gotta pound some logic into their heads impossible sighs where s dr logan frankenstein he s in his laboratory where else man there s a loss of initiative caution many of the human cognitive functions apparently the result of decay in the frontal parietal temporal and occipital lobes on revival the rate of decomposition slows substantially switch clicks indications are that these beings could function over a period of years in cases of early revival to years before decay would threaten mobility screams growls moaning the brain is the engine sarah the motor that drives them they don t need any blood flow don t need any of their internal organs now i ve severed all the vital organs in this one there s nothing left of the corpse but brain and limbs and still it functions oh look sarah look grunting see it wants me it wants food but it has no stomach it can take no nourishment from what it ingests it s working on instinct a deep dark primordial instinct decomposition occurs first in the frontal lobes the neocortex and next in the limbic system the middle brain but the core the core is the last thing to be attacked by the decay it s the r complex sarah that central bit of prehistoric jelly that we inherited from the reptiles here i ve gone into the center here and attacked the r complex discretely i ve removed it from the equation this corpse i believe this creature would be benign even if it had its eyesight and its other senses its primitive instincts have been erased machine whirring it still has motor function probably still has powers of deliberation it can be domesticated sarah don t you see it can be conditioned to behave the way we want it to behave and all that s required is hours of fancy surgery that only a handful of people are trained to do we were going to stop work on the neurophysical concentrate on something more practical these finds are central to the condition i will not stop work that might lead to an answer let alone in an area that is central to the condition exhales forcefully but you re just proving theories that were advanced months ago and you re not even proving them correctly you re making a lot of assumptions you re wasting time trying to define what s happening instead of looking for what s making it happen and just slicing up too many specimens it s extremely dangerous to go up on top and round them up in the wild well we can t control them what happened to this one doctor it was too unruly i couldn t handle it i had to destroy it we can still get information from it dr logan we are losing the cooperation of the men i m not even sure they ll go up top when we run out of the specimens we have i m not sure they won t just try to shut us down completely well i ll show them results i ll show them results i ll show them that these creatures can be domesticated even without the surgery knowing what they are we can begin to approach them properly condition them control them we ve got to do this sarah it s our only hope yes this is major cooper i needed him sarah he s helping us more now than he ever did when he was alive but i saw the grave they buried one of the specimens jesus god logan do you know what they ll do to you if they find out about this do you know what they ll do to all of us they ll never find out he can t be recognized moaning gasping moaning not a peep long range or short high band or low i can t raise anybody man how can that be mcdermott there must be other groups like us somebody else must be tryin to radio yeah what the hell is this maybe we are the only ones left i m sure there s others this is not the best place to be sending from and a lot of the equipment i m using has been rotting down here since the second world war well it s up to you to get it workin right lay off the fuckin booze for a while why don t ya and get somebody on that fuckin horn pronto well if we stay down here long enough i ll have to lay off the fuckin booze steel cause there won t fuckin be any of it fuckin left in the meanwhile i will continue to indulge myself and i will continue doing my best in the good fight against dry rot and rust yeah well your best ain t good enough asshole you think i m not aware of our situation you think i want to stay isolated down here you know i d make a desperate effort to raise somebody just in the hope of gettin away from your nasty mouth steel the fact is the fact is either we are the only ones left or there s nobody within range of my puny little second world war signals we used to talk to washington all the time they could hear us then we were on relays then we weren t over the air you know the power s off on the mainland now in case you haven t heard all the shopping malls are closed we don t appreciate your jokes keep it up and i ll

fisher you ve lost one man men yeah right we ve lost five men murmuring agreement where does it say we gotta keep those dumb fucks next door to where we sleep where does it say we should do any one thing but shoot the mothers in the head logan we don t have enough ammunition to shoot them all in the head the time to have done that would ve been at the beginning no we let them overrun us they

of here and leave you and your highfalutin asshole friends to rot in this stinkin sewer is that food enough for ya where will you go captain you can destroy my specimens but what about the millions more that are waiting to greet you outside do you really think you can blow the piss out of them all of them they have you in a hopeless situation strategically you re lost well you re lost unless

been making isn t that right sarah yes there s been some progress what kind of progress what are you talkin about make them behave what does that mean it means keeping them from wanting to eat us for one thing it means keeping them in check controlling them controlling them when are you gonna show us something we can understand very close very close i think in a matter of weeks i don t think there s any way you can tell how long anything is going to take it could be months it could be years before we know exactly what we re dealing with men murmuring sarah s research louder sarah s research is more esoteric than mine murmuring stops she s looking for a way to reverse the process a way to eradicate the problem that could take a long time a very long time she may never find what she s looking for we have a limited supply of chemical agents our equipment is hopelessly inadequate mcdermott doesn t have decent radio gear now you re tellin me that you don t have the shit you need we re runnin low on ammunition we re runnin low on men for chrissakes it was very rushed this operation was put together in a matter of days yeah well it can all be taken apart in a matter of minutes lady and i m here to tell you that i m ready to do that little thing i m ready to take the next train outta here logan i ask you again captain where will you go you have no choices you ll have to give us the weeks that we ve asked for you have to give us however long it takes look there have to be survivors in washington man my ass they have more sophisticated shelters than this one man bullshit there have to be people in those shelters who know about us who know where we are with no radio contact they ll come looking for us men murmuring i said shut up you got a little more time a little more i ain t sayin how much but you d better start showin me some results and you d better not piss me off you understand nothin happens around here without my knowin about it and anybody fucks with my command they get court martialed they get executed you d better know i mean it too people men murmuring he wouldn t have done it i can t believe he would ve no he wouldn t have done it he would ve had steel do it he can t be that inhuman no he s human that s what scares me you know he won t shoot billy cause he doesn t have anybody else who knows electronics he won t shoot me cause i m his ride he probably won t shoot old frankenstein cause the old doc can talk him silly but the rest of you better start worrying you know maybe if we tried working together we could ease some of the tensions we re all pulling in different directions that s the trouble sarah people got different ideas concerning what they want out of life gasps you are afraid aren t you just as afraid as i am why don t you take a sedative sarah so you can sleep you re full of shit sarah you know that you re really full of shit i m through with you fine then get out just get out clattering growling growling continues

venture any theories from the medical perspective i wish i could from what i ve heard the first few isolated cases were diag creutzfeldt jakob disease cjd mad cow an evolved strain yes doctors believe that the symptoms muscle twitches poor coordination seizures and delirium are similar appears to spread through blood on blood contact or saliva on blood contact a virus that can be transmitted by bite so you re saying it was n t cjd yes look what you ve got to appreciate is that the sufferers are extremely violent so doctors were limited in correctly diagnosing the illness but it soon became clear that the patients heart rates had stopped stopped or slowed and how s that come on this phenomena being ventured by religious groups shirley sawyer of the westboro baptist church the west wales based organization notorious for picketing soldiers funerals and its vehement anti homosexual stance released the following statement if you say that it s okay to be gay you re looking at a doomed people when you say gay pride you have obviously given over any notion that you re sinning what is happening now is god s judgment on you for indulging in or condoning hedonistic lifestyles come on

to know who you people are and what s going on here now you and i have the same employer we work for the umbrella corporation the mansion above is an emergency entance to the hive you were security operatives placed three to protect that entrance what about this your marriage is a fake just your cover to protect the secrecy of the hive and what is the hive show them accessing schematic of the hive raccoon city nearest urban center the mansion where we found you and gained access to the train which in turn brought us to the hive the hive is located underground deep beneath the streets of raccoon city a secret research facility owned and operated by the umbrella corporation the hive houses over technicians scientists and support staff they live and work underground their research is of the highest importance its nature is classified our position on the map is indicated by heat signature why ca n t i remembe anything the hive has its own defense mechanisms all computer controlled a nerve gas was released into the house primary effect of the gas complete unconsciousness lasting up to four hours secondary effects can include acute memory loss for how long subjective an hour day week so this place was attacked i m afraid things are a little more complicated than that sir we ve breached the hive j d got it halon has dissipated easier to work undeground thinking there s a view looks like we re taking the stairs status red queen s locked on to us she knows we re here who s the red queen state of the art artificial intelligence the computer that controls the hive this will slow us down our route to the queen takes us straight through these labs rain j d see how bad the flooding is kaplan find an alternate route what happened here five hours ago red queen went homicidal sealed the hive and killed everyone here jesus when we realized what happened we were dispatched to shut her down why did she do it we do n t know but outside interference is a possibility jesus you okay here no i m fine it s cold in here are you do you remember anything from before this no nothing before the train and you nothing i found an alternate route but it will cost us time if we double back cut through dining hall b we re right on track sir no go the whole level s flooded all ight we re behind schedule so let s move it come on poor bastards kaplan dining hall b that s what s on the map maybe you re reading it wrong maybe the corporation keeps secrets here something you re not supposed to see j d you and rain keep the prisoner here and secure the exit halon levels are nonexistent i think the system malfunctioned there may be survivos give me a search line but keep it tight move it i said keep it tight sorry i m not sure i want to remember what went on down here i do n t blame you what the hell do they keep in these how do i know what s taking so long red queen s defenses are in place she s making it difficult let s pack it up you stay here the lights are automated nothing to worry about transmitter in position roger running a bypass checkmate move up what is that that will shut the queen down delivers a massive electrical charge forces the mainframe to reboot kaplan a dormant defense mechanism we must ve tripped it put it back to sleep working on it open that door i m trying hold your positions stay calm what s that get them out something s happening in there come on help them down get down something s killing them do n t do this medic medic open the door i m trying you re going into shock stay awake almost there it s coming back open it i m trying try harder it s coming back oh god do it almost there come on shit got it all right let s do it do what we have to complete the mission no way i ll go down there her defenses are down d ja vu anyone keep going give me a hand get out you ca n t be in here do n t listen she s a holographic representation of the red queen get out modeled after the programmer s daughter she ll deceive us confuse us i would n t advise this disabling me will result in loss of primary power she ll say anything to stop us from shutting her down i implore you implore away please please you re all going to die down here that pulse forces the circuit breaker to shut down her mainframe for seconds after that if i do n t have her boards he can reboot they re late i m on it j d we got a survivor we re here to help you seem to be in some sort of get off get off of me get her off me before i stab her ass you okay she bit me man she took a chunk right out of me stay back i m warning you stay down she s crazy come any closer and i ll fire i mean it damn you i shot her five times how was she still standing bitch is n t standing now what was all the shooting we found a survivor and you shot him she was crazed she bit me she s gone she s gone bullshit she fell right here but she s gone look at this there s blood but it s not much looks coagulated yeah it s not possible why not blood does n t do that till after you re dead can we go now not till the rest of the team get here there s no one else coming what the fuck you talking about wait quiet fuck do n t come any closer they re behind us jesus they re everywhere they re everywhere they re all around us i said stay back why are n t they dying watch the tank the tank let s go hurry up wait come on move come on move i can help you get the virus i have security codes surveillance plans the works shit we lost the others keep moving you waited did n t know the code come on shit come on hurry up shit come on shit what s taking so long i m trying come on move what s the code hurry i m running out of ammo no fuck what what is the code got it see how easy that was shit grab my hand man do n t let go where are the bodies where did they go fuck whatever they are there s too many whatever they are it s pretty obvious what they are lab coats badges those people used to work here all the people working here are dead that is n t stopping them from walking around where did they come from why did n t we see them on the way in when you cut the power you unlocked the doors you let them out we re never gon na make it to the surface you are security operatives placed there to protect that entrance lisa i ve got one in the breech and an extra mag i can help you get the virus i have access to security codes surveillance plans the works but but there will be a price name it who was she my sister corporations like umbrella think they re above the law but they re not there are hundreds of thousands of us who think the same all over the world some of us provide information others give their support some take more direct action like you if your friends had been more thorough they would ve seen through my false i d then all the red flags would ve gone off quantico nsa vicap all the rest there s no way i could ve infiltrated the hive so you sent your sister we needed something concrete anything to expose umbrella to the press proof of the research going on down here what kind of research the illegal kind genetic viral my sister was going to smuggle out a sample of the virus they were developing how was she going to make it out she had a contact within the hive someone i never met they had access to security codes surveillance every thing she needed so why did n t she make it maybe she trusted the wrong person maybe they set her up kept the virus fo themselves do you have any idea what the t virus would be worth on the open market worth all this yeah to someone do n t shoot close that door they re right behind us close that door get off son of a bitch you okay yeah right behind us what about this door they e waiting there too and that way dead end there s no way out of the queen s chamber so we wait someone does n t hear fom you they ll send backup or something right what what s wrong we do n t have much time those blast doors we passed on the way in from the mansion they seal shut in under an hour if we re not out by then we re not getting out what are you talking about they ca n t just bury us alive down here containing the incident is the only fail safe plan they had against possible contamination and you re telling us this now when we re trapped half a mile underground we have to find a way out of this room what are you doing where are you taking those i m turning her back on that s not a good idea she ll know a way out of here that homicidal bitch killed my team that homicidal bitch may be our only way out of here considering the way she s been treated i m sure she s real happy to help us out that circuit breaker you were talking about can you bypass it yeah so do it cicuit breaker s disabled this time if i hit the switch she wo n t shut down she ll fry the charge must ve damaged her boards there you are things i gather have gone out of control give me that switch right now i ll fry your ass i did warn you did n t i tell us what s going on down here research and development what about the t vius the t virus was a major medical breakthrough although it clearly also possessed highly profitable military applications how does it explain those things out there even in death the human body remains active hair and fingernails continue to grow new cells are produced and the brain holds a small electrical charge that takes months to dissipate the t virus provides a massive jolt both to cellular growth and to those trace electrical impulses put quite simply it reanimates the body it brings the dead back to life not fully the subjects have the simplest of motor functions perhaps a little memory virtually no intelligence they are driven by the basest of impulses the most basic of needs which is the need to feed how do you kill them severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain are the most effective methods you mean shoot them in the head why did you kill every body down here the t virus escaped into the air conditioning system and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began the virus is protean changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission depending on its environment it s almost impossible to kill i could n t allow it to escape from the hive so i took steps steps you must understand those who become infected i ca n t allow you to leave we re not infected just one bite one scratch from these creatures is sufficient and then you become one of them a check of my systems indicates my main drive circuit breaker has been disabled may i ask why insurance we need a way out of here if you refuse to help we flip the switch understand after you what the hell is this place the utility tunnels they run underneath the hive fo wate gas and power lines been in here before keep moving going ound in circles this is the route the computer gave i do n t know why you listen to her enough we have no choice but to keep moving because those things are behind us got it that mesh wo n t hold keep moving jesus christ hold it there s too many of them fuck up on the pipes up on the pipes quickly everyone up on the pipes let s go come on there s a way up keep them back go on up move it look out get over here there s too many of them go go go go on i can manage go jd what we have to do something about your wounds i m fine i said i m fine you like that do n t you you like the way it tastes do n t you like the taste of that she was right we re all going to die down here no we re getting out all of us you okay god get away hold on come on help him i ca n t what are you waiting for i ca n t focus i ca n t see go up climb up there you got ta keep going come on go you can do it move you got it stay there we ll get you we need to cut this wire and throw it to him then we ll get him hold on that s lucky i want you to go i m not leaving you yes you are you ca n t kill all of them i m not going anywhere i want you to go now please just do it just do it now please go you ll have to work for your meal come on give me your arm okay over

mutation or it can help her walk again if the virus is kept in check with this angie s infected yes the cellular growth is enough to regenerate her but not enough to cause mutation and they infected you with the t virus as well yeah but do n t worry i m not contagious here tape the story i ll see that it gets put to good use my name is alice i worked for the umbrella corporation the largest and

coming back to is spanish flu spanish flu it did n t exist in but by it killed of the world he s our best bet at figuring out what this thing is you all read the same email i did and it said zombies scientists protesting are you completely out of your mind so the earliest mention of the word zombie was in a memo from camp humphreys in south korea we have n t had contact with them since but this could lead us to the origin if we knew where this thing started then we d have a chance of developing a vaccine to stop it so we send in dr fassbach there to look for the source he s just a kid you re right sergeant attention on deck at ease mr under secretary the under secretary here says you were his best investigator when you were at the u n i want to send you in with a team help dr fassbach

same conclusion it s the duty of the tenth man to disagree no matter how improbable it may seem the tenth man has to start digging on the assumption that the other nine are wrong and you were that tenth man precisely since everyone assumed that this talk of zombies was cover for something else i began my investigation on the assumption that when they said zombies they meant zombies was patient

worst disease growling dr kelly he wants a what deadly pathogen with a high mortality rate but curable okay well you d want a bacteria rather than a virus i would think typhus meningitis scarlet fever dr kelly rocky mountain fever anyway excuse me what s this for mr lane believes we can use such a disease against the undead scoffs i would give you points for originality mr lane if we had n t already tried that first thing one of the many things a virus or bacteria needs to thrive is a live host a functioning circulatory system i m afraid it boils down to one simple fact you ca n t make a dead person sick sighs it s not for them it s for us i believe these things have a weakness and that weakness is weakness our weakness snarling i have witnessed them literally bypass people walk right around them like a river around a rock why i think because those people were sick i think they were terminal and these things could sense it i think they re spreading a pathogen and they need a healthy host but even if you re right i mean infecting the populace with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure it s not a cure it s camouflage it s camouflage there s a natural precedent hungry predators will avoid diseased bodies equipped with the right pathogen our troops would be essentially invisible to the enemy you understand the only way to prove this theory of yours is for some idiot to infect themselves with a lethal pathogen and then banging meet with her face to face snorts yes do we have what we need to try it dr kelly we have all he could want typhus h n sars the problem is they re all stored in b wing what s the matter with b wing brit dr spellman our chief vaccinologist within hours of the outbreak he d been sent blood samples to try and isolate the pathogenic cause unfortunately this is b wing now sighs muttering god damn it how many how many are there there were people working there i ve never seen them move like that brit they re dormant they re awaiting stimulus now this is vault that s where your samples would be this is the skybridge that connects b wing to the main building here and this is the only thing standing between us and the skybridge so what do you propose mr lane dr kelly you are not serious b wing s a maze they ll never make it back alone we do n t even know if his theory is correct javier well i know i m not asking one of you to take him there each has its merits last resort it s too loud let s go try not to kill one it only makes the rest of them more aggressive yeah you sure you want to do this of course i m not let s go
